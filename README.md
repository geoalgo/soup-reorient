soup-reorient
=============

Reorientation of triangle soups into 2-manifold meshes.

The file lans.off comes from AIM@SHAPE repository (http://shapes.aim-at-shape.net/).

Usage : run this command to reorient your mesh lans.off into output.off:

./soup-reorient PATH_TO_DATA/lans.off PATH_TO_DATA/output.off

You can do other stuff as well (saving oriented triangles into a .ply file),
see Custom_visitor.cpp example.
